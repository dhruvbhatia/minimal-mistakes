This is where I list the side projects that I work on in my free time.

### First Drum Pty Ltd

<a href="https://firstdrum.com" target="_blank"><img src="/images/fd-logo.png"></a>

I am a Co-Founder of <a href="https://firstdrum.com" target="_blank">First Drum Pty Ltd</a>, which offers Managment, Technology, and Data Consulting Services to companies within the APAC region.

Check out <a href="https://firstdrum.com" target="_blank">our website</a> for further information.

### FB Lead Gen

<a href="http://fbleadgen.com" target="_blank"><img src="/images/fblg-box.png"></a>

<a href="http://fbleadgen.com" target="_blank">FB Lead Gen</a> is a simple self-hosted app that allows companies to capture email leads using a Facebook OAuth button and feed them directly into their email marketing platform. Why have users fill out forms when they can just click a button?
