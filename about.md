Hi, I'm Dhruv, a young Gen Y from Melbourne, Australia. I like playing with new technologies and finding practical applications for them. I built this site to share my thoughts and circulate things that interest me. There are **three key subjects** that content here will focus on:

* Startup/Technology News
* Data-Driven Marketing
* My Personal Projects

## Fun Facts:

* Progressive Rock is my favourite genre of music. Every smartdevice I own *must* have Pink Floyd on it[^1].
* Hong Kong is my favourite travel destination to date.
* I've worked across a wide spectrum of places.. from small startups, to large corporates. Perspective is a *great* thing.
* Favourite quote: `Change the world, or be changed by it.`

## Get In Touch:

All of my posts here will have a Disqus powered commentary widget. I encourage you to contribute your thoughts.
Alternatively, feel free to contact me through one of the social networks on the left, or drop me an email:
