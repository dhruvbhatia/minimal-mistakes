Just the other day I had a non-technical colleague tell me that they wanted to invest in Bitcoin. It seems the world is going crazy over Cryptocurrencies as of late, as evident by the trajectory in this Google Trends chart[^1]:

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com.au/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=bitcoin&date=today+3-m&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=710&h=330"></script>

Truth be told, I've known about Cryptocurrenies for some time now, but I've been one of the few that has avoided delving into them too deeply.

However, given all the hype, I thought I'd spend some time researching the feasibility of investing/mining for them. This post is designed to provide my findings.

### Cryptocurrencies 101

> Dhruv, what the hell are these Cryptocurrency things you speak of?

Good question.

In a nutshell, Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that, just like paper money, allow users to purchase goods and services in exchange for them. However, unlike offline money, Cryptocurrencies are unregulated and highly anonymous. There is no central government or bank that manages the supply and flow of them. Instead, users all over the world run software on their computers and this collective decentralised network acts as the authority that issues currency to parties and verifies subsequent transactions.

The network itself is incentivised for it's efforts in helping to verify transactions & keep a track record of currency movements between parties. This incentivisation is referred to **mining**, and involves certain units of the Cryptocurrency being *unlocked* and shared amongst the nodes in the network.

*Note: My explanation above is highly simplistic. If you want to learn more I'd highly recommend <a href="http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/" target="_blank">**How the Bitcoin protocol actually works**</a> by Michael Nielsen.*

### Show me the money

> Dhruv, you're saying my computer can make money without me doing anything?! How much money can I make through mining Cryptocurrencies?

Another good question.

By being a peer in the network and contributing your resources towards being the decentralised authority, you will be rewarded with the respective Cryptocurrency. This can be changed to real-world cash through an exchange, or used to buy stuff online.

However, mining is a field with many complexities.

Cryptocurrencies are designed to compensate for things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law" target="_blank">Moore's Law</a>, which essentially hypothesises that the speed of computers over time is exponential. As such, mining becomes harder over time. Mining was once effective on CPUs, but miners progressed their efforts from CPUs to GPUs to FPGAs and are now utilising ASICs (specialised machines designed to do one task - and one task only - at super speeds). As a result, the guy mining with a CPU in today's environment will see minimum yield. Often, the cost of electricity to power their computer will outweigh the return.

## As such, I conclude that mining, under today's conditions, is a waste of time for the common man.

> Well, what about investing rather than mining? Will that work?

You may be late to the mining party, but let's consider Cryptocurrencies as an investment.

The OHLC chart above shows that Bitcoin has grown by 7000% in the past 12 months[^2]. Yup, 7000%. Not 13.83% like the ASX All Ords. Nope. 7000%.

If you invested $20k into each of the above 12 months ago, your returns will be as follows:

| Investment                    | Amount Invested (Y₀) | Return (%) | Amount Returned (Y₁) |
|:------------------------------|:----------------------:|:-----:|:-------------------------:|
| ASX All Ord                   | $20,000              | 13.83% | $22,766 |
|----
| Bitcoin                       | $20,000              | 7,000.00% | $1,400,000 |

I love speculative investment opportunities, and anyone that knows me can attest to this, but I seriously question the sustainability of the growth that Cryptocurrencies have experienced lately.

If I were to consider investing in Cryptocurrencies, I wouldn't look at prior growth and trajectory as key metrics. Instead, I would consider things like:

* Whether I see said Cryptocurrency becoming a widespread medium that will be used in a barter system (after all, that is the goal of all these currencies, right?).

* Whether governments can prevent said currency from aiming to substitute paper currency.

* Whether there will be a market to sell said currency for real-world cash once they meet my desired/predicted return.

## With the above in mind, I feel that investing in Cryptocurrencies right now doesn't make sense. While they have seen supernova-like growth recently, I don't believe this trend is sustainable.

### Conclusion

While I don't feel that Cryptocurrency mining or investing is a good idea right now, you can bet that I'll be keeping my eye on progressions in the digital currency world as researching their respective background, working, and future growth potential has proven to be fascinating.
