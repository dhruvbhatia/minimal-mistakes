I've heard a lot about <a href="http://www.kaggle.com" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> over the course of the past few years, but only recently took the plunge and signed up.

### What is Kaggle?

Kaggle is essentially a site in which big corporates post up a specific **big data** problem that they're facing, and the public can compete amongst one-another towards finding a best-fit solution.

The challenges on Kaggle vary in both nature and industry, but here are some of the ones I found interesting:

* <a href="http://www.gequest.com/c/flight2-main" target="_blank">General Electric's Aviation arm wants a real-time BI solution to optimise flight plans based on everchanging factors</a> *(a massive scale application of game theory)*.

* <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/online-sales" target="_blank">Predicting a company's product sales based on advertising efforts</a> *(this is very similar to what I do in my day job)*.

* <a href="http://www.heritagehealthprize.com/c/hhp" target="_blank">HPN wants to predict a user's likelihood of going to hospital within the next year, based on their historical claims</a>

### How does a Kaggle competition work?

Users are allowed to sign-up and participate in most new competitions (though some are exclusive to Kaggle members that were in the Top *x* percentile, based on their historical performance).

Each competition will provide a detailed description of the problem, and will also supply any test/training/sample datasets if applicable. There is also a forum for each competition should users want to ask questions.

Users work on building their models, and can freely upload the results of their models into the system throughout the course of each competition. A Leaderboard evaluates all submissions, and shows everyone's ranking in real-time. At the end of a competition, winners are often rewarded with prizes in exchange for their model.

A user's performance within a competition will directly impact their Overall Ranking within their profile.

### What type of users are on Kaggle?

I've found that Kaggle's userbase is quite diverse. Users range from seasoned scientists, to those that are brand new to data problems.

In my short time there, I've already connected with a PhD in Europe that specialises in image recognition machine learning, a like-minded digital marketer, and a South American working within the computer forensics field.

### Conclusion

My only regret is that I wish I had joined Kaggle sooner! So far, I'm enjoying it as it a) provides an opportunity to strengthen my analytical skills; and b) allows me to network with like-minded people.

I hope the above serves well as an introduction to the Kaggle platform.

**Update (Jan 4th 2014):** Readers have requested that I follow this entry up with practical posts. In the future I'll be explaining how to build models to solve specific problems. Stay tuned!
