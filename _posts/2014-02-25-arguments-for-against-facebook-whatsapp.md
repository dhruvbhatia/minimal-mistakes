<a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/805/Facebook-to-Acquire-WhatsApp" target="_blank">Facebook's acquistion of WhatsApp</a> last week has resulted in a spectrum of reactions from journalists, financial analysts, employees at said companies and common lay people.

I've read countless arguments supporting and opposing the transaction, and wanted to present a list of the most compelling reasons I see for either side.

### Terms of the deal

Firstly, let me recap the terms of the acquisition.

Facebook acquired WhatsApp on February 19, 2014.
The deal is worth about **$19bn USD** and consists of the following key components:

* 184m Facebook shares (valued at **$12bn**).
* 46m restricted Facebook shares (valued at **$3bn**)[^1].
* **$4bn** in cash.
* A seat for Jan Koum, WhatsApp co-founder/CEO, on Facebook's board[^2].
* Independent management of the WhatsApp brand, service and mission.
* A **$1bn** cash *break-up fee* if Facebook chose to revoke the deal.

### Why the deal DOES make sense

Key arguments supporting the acquisition:

#### Strength of key product metrics
WhatsApp has some extremely strong and unprecedented usage metrics.

Take the *Monthly Active User* count for instance, which tracks the number of uniques that use the app per month. This currently stands at **465m** after a mere four years. The rate of growth from Y⁰ - Y⁴ trumps other consumer software startups:

</figure>
<br>

WhatsApp's trajectory in the above growth doesn't look to be slowing down, either. They are reportedly gaining <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/with-whatsapp-deal-facebook-is-all-grown-up-2014-03-03" target="blank">**1m new users per day**</a>.

In addition, WhatsApp's penetration in markets where Facebook Messenger is under-indexing is of interest. WhatsApp has **70%+** market share in a number of countries:

<br>

#### Competitors were expressing interest

Another common argument in favour of the acquisition is that it was a necessary defensive move on Facebook's part.

> Had Facebook not bought WhatsApp, a competitor likely would have.

Given that <a href="http://9to5google.com/2014/02/20/google-tried-to-buy-whatsapp-for-10b-before-facebook-succeeded-with-19b-purchase/" target="blank">Google had previously tried to acquire WhatsApp for **$10bn**</a>, it's clear that WhatsApp was having conversations with competitors. Had Facebook not bought WhatsApp, a competitor likely would have.

Facebook's core mission is about <a href="http://investor.fb.com/faq.cfm" target="blank">connecting people using technology</a>. They essentially want a monopoly on social networking, so allowing a competitor to swoop up WhatsApp would threaten this position.

### Why the deal DOESN'T many sense

Now allow me to flip sides and discuss key arguments that oppose the acquisition:

#### Facebook will struggle to monetise WhatsApp
Seeing an ROI on that $19bn will be challenging, given that <a href="http://blog.whatsapp.com/index.php/2012/06/why-we-dont-sell-ads/" target="blank">WhatsApp has a strict anti-advertising policy</a>, and that advertising is the main force behind Facebook's business model.

WhatsApp's current revenue generation strategy involves charging users $1 USD per annum. This means that there is effectively a *revenue ceiling* of *Number of Paying Users \* $1* (currently $465m USD p.a.). At this rate, it will take a long time for Facebook to see a return.

Some back of the envelope math:
For simplicity, let's just assume growth stays fixed at 1m users per day and all users end up paying. At this rate, WhatsApp would have generated a cumulative $20.6bn in revenue by mid January 2023:

<br>

My assumptions above are highly optimistic and I only account for revenue (not profit), so it's easy to see why skeptics think it will be tough for Facebook to see the black on their investment.

#### WhatsApp is cloneable
WhatsApp is clearly a feat of solid engineering, given the scale of messages it reliably processes with such a small team. However, the core concept of the app is quite basic and easily cloneable.

There are a ton of similar messaging apps, some with additional features.

> We all know what happened to MySpace when Facebook began to rise, so who's to say the same can't happen to WhatsApp?

The *lock-in effect* of social networks is still a big unknown. We all know what happened to MySpace when Facebook began to rise, so who's to say the same can't happen to WhatsApp?

### Conclusion

I won't offer which side of the fence I sit on, as I see the merit in arguments from both sides. This will certainly be an interesting story to watch!


[^1]: Restricted shares are those whose redemption is pending a certain condition attached to them.
[^2]: Jan acquiring a seat on Facebook's board appears to have confused some commentators, but it makes sense given a) Jan is now a significant shareholder in Facebook; and b) one of the deal terms involved independent management of the WhatsApp entity.
