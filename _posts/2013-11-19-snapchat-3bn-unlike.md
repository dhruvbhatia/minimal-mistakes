One of the most discussed stories in the tech industry this week is how <a href="http://www.snapchat.com">Snapchat, a mobile photo sharing app</a>, allegedly <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/13/snapchat-spurned-3-billion-acquisition-offer-from-facebook/" target="_blank">rejected a $3bn acquisition offer</a> from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mark-Zuckerberg/112845672063384" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.

A lot of the commentary I've read that surrounds the news is filled with astonishment and shock. People simply can't understand how you can turn down that type of offer. Especially when you operate a business with **no** revenue model.

I wanted to speculate on the top three reasons that could have motivated the rejection.

### Facebook had previously tried to clone Snapchat

Facebook clearly want to be a dominant force in the mobile space. Problem is, they were quite late to the party. While startups were dreaming up fresh new ideas and pushing the boundaries as to what is possible on a mobile device, Facebook were busy shipping half-baked <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/09/11/html5-biggest-mistake/" target="_blank">HTML5 based apps that performed terribly and were ridden with bugs</a>. They were simply behind the eight-ball in the mobile space.

After seeing Snapchat's traction, Facebook <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/facebook-poke-app/" target="_blank">launched a like-for-like mobile app called Facebook Poke</a> late last year. It was a carbon copy of Snapchat, and even featured Snapchat's secret sauce - the ability to send photos that expire after *x* seconds.

Much to Zuck's dismay, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/08/facebook-snapchat/" target="_blank">Facebook Poke flopped</a>.

**Having one of the biggest companies on the planet rip off your idea would surely be grounds for not wanting to deal with them in any capacity in the future.**

### Incremental richness doesn't change anything

I was listening to the latest episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech/432" target="_blank">TWiT, a podcast that covers tech news</a> during my commute this morning, and one of the guests mentioned that the founders of Snapchat were already well-off.

That got me thinking.. if you are already comfortable with your material possessions, no amount of money will really sway you. That seems to be a hard construct for people to emphathise with, but I think it's true.

Facts: Despite the lack of a revenue model, Snapchat is <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/snapchat" target="_blank">an extremely well-funded company</a> that is on a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/snapchat-now-sees-350m-photos-shared-daily-up-from-200m-in-june/" target="_blank">trajectory</a>.

**A second Rolls Royce in the garage doesn't make as much of a difference as the first.**

### Vision

The final, and frankly, main, reason that I think Snapchat rejected Facebook's offer boils down to the **vision of the company and it's founders**. Economics is quite simple and can be distilled into this: *you transact if you think a proposition is valuable.*

**I believe that the Snapchat team feel that there is a lot more value they add to their product, and subsequently contribute to the world.**

Time will tell. I wish them the best of luck.
